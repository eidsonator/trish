## Install

It will be possible to install with

```fish
$ omf install trish
```

...after I request OMF maintainers to add trish to their repos. For now, I'd recommend manually putting the files in your fish functions folder:

```fish
$ git clone https://github.com/victante/trish
$ mv trish/functions/* ~/.config/fish/functions
```


## Usage

```fish
$ trish
```


## Missing parts

These still need to be implemented:

- The help argument in each function;
- This Readme file, explaining how to use each function.

These are already working:

- trish function (to put files in the trash);
- trishl function (to list what's in the trash);
- trishc function (to clean the trash, or parts of it);
- trishr functions (to restore items from the trash).


## The name

'Trish' is a mashup of 'trash' and 'fish'. Kinda obvious, but I'm personally very proud of it.
