## Install

### OMF

If/when OMF maintainers approve this package on their repo, it will be easier to install:

```

### Fisher

```fish
$ fisher install victante/trish
```

### Fundle

Insert `fundle plugin 'victante/trish'` in your config.fish, before the `fundle init` line. Reload the shell and then run:

```fish
$ fundle install
```

### Manual installation

```fish
$ git clone https://github.com/victante/trish
$ mv trish/functions/* ~/.config/fish/functions
```


## Usage

```fish
$ trish ITEMS # send ITEMS to the trash
$ trishl # list what's in the trash
$ trishl [-p INT/--peek INT/-INT] # list the contents of the deleted folder of index INT
$ trishc # enter interactive mode for cleaning the trash
$ trishc [-a/--all] # clean the entire trash folder at once
$ trishc [-o INT/--old INT/-INT] # clean all files that were in the trash for INT days or more
$ trishr # enter interactive mode for restoring items from the trash
$ trishr [-a/--all] # restore all items from the trash
```

All 4 functions also have a '-h/--help' flag to display a nice little help text.


## The name

'Trish' is a mashup of 'trash' and 'fish'. Kinda obvious, but I'm personally very proud of it.
